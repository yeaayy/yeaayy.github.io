      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">About Me</h2>
      <p>I made this site mainly because I want to create archive of thing I made since I feel I'm wasting my
        time creating thing. I also want to share my creation with people so I don't feel wasting my time for
        nothing.

      <p class="mt-4">There isn't much I can tell about my educational background because it's not important and I
        didn't come from notable university or school. Formaly I study Information Technology (IT), but I much
        more into
        science (especially computer science) and game development. I can do math but only up to simple linear
        algebra
        and simple calculus. I try to study more advance topic but my head just can't take it.</p>
