  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">What is in this page?</h2>
  <p>This is where is put my stuff when I make something interesting. I also put some of my interest here and
    a little bit about myself.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">I made this site mainly because I want to create archive of thing I made. I feel spending too much
    on it so I want to know how much thing I actually made (and finished). The other reason is I also want to share
    my creation with people.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">About Me (Short)</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Formaly I study Information Technology (IT), but I much more into math, science (especially
    computer science) and game development. There isn't much else I can tell about my educational background because
    it's not relevant and I didn't come from notable university or school. I can do math but only up to simple
    linear algebra and simple calculus. I try to study more advance topic but my head just can't take it.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">I wouldn't write much about math, science or game dev anywhere else, because they are just boring
    to talk about. Open the <NuxtLink to="/about" class="text-white hover:underline font-bold">long version
    </NuxtLink> or other tabs if you want to know more.
